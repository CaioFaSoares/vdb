# FIX
- Modal opening new window instead of closing when click outside on mobile (touch)
- Backend update_deck_route errors

# FEATURES
- Inventory cards with notes filter to crypt/library/inventory
- Tournament analyze urls

# MAYBE LATER FEATURES
- Offline decks/inventory storage
- Playable by crypt filter to library
- Q-ty in card selection

# POSSIBLE IMPROVEMENTS
- Migration from screen width (isWide, etc) to container queries
- Explicit image width/height
- Refactor Deck Buttons (split in button ui and function incl. deckstore functions)
- Back button behavior
- Improve light theme colors (fgPrimary and fgSecondary to be more distinctive?)

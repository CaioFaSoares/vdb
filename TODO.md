# FIX
- Older links (redirect in the web server)
- Check TWD - check countries/cities (to repeat previously used cities)
- Text multi search

# FEATURES
- Events decks archive analyzing
- Custom values for cardtypes in TWD/PDA
- Playable by buttons to lib/crypt

- Refactor deck buttons (split in button ui and function incl. deckstore functions )
- Explicit image width/height
- ResultDisciplineImage class to width/size
- Refactor fetch to useFetch where possible
- Add standard modal button blocks
- TwdResultLibrary (crypt also?) refactor to use banned check

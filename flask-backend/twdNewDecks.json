So, Shatter the Gates with MMA gains it was.\n\nFirst round started quite nicely and I delivered shattered counters early on. Unfortunately Peetu also got his game running fast, gaining with Kaymakli fragment and voting damage. 1vp for me, not a disaster, but less than I was hoping for.\n\nSecond round was terrible. Again, I was playing the table to Peetu, who was my prey. I couldn\u00b4t defend my shatter the gates and still I was stubbornly trying to play them. 0vp, and another GW for Peetu.\n\nThird round saved the day. If i recall correctly, I didn\u00b4t get shatters, but gained enough, bled enough, talked enough to manage a GW and place in the final table. Close call and a bleeding race with Pasi in the end.\n\nIn the finals seating was me -> Tero (Malgorzata/Lord Tremere/Mistress Fanchon) -> Peetu (Giotto Verducci/Nos princes) -> Tom (Unnamed) -> Emma (Ventrue). From earlier rounds it was obvious that Peetu was the table threat. Also it seemed that Teros deck was not fast enough to put any pressure and there was very little that Tom could do backwards to Peetu.\n\nI decided to not play shatters at all. Instead, we had a similar understanding of the table with Emma; Tom had to go first, then we would do anything to help Tero oust Peetu. After that, hopefully I could oust Tero and we both would have a chance to win the game (and tournee).\n\nPlan worked like a charm. Close call though and (don\u00b4t qiute remember the details, but) coordinating bounces and well timed DI was needed as very often is the case. Great Beast helped a lot. In the end I think I had Cybele, Beastie, Veneficti and legionnaires to bleed and liquidation/Ashurs running nicely and duel with Emma was quite easy at that point.\n\nFinals thought of the deck.\nIt was kinda fun to play for a while. Liquidation/Ashurs are way too strong and i wont be playing those without a really good reason. Babalawo is awesome. And so is the Great Beast. Those I most definetily will be playing a lot more and in different kind of decks. I was mostly worried about combat decks and surviving with direct rushes. I was lucky I guess, since I really don\u00b4t recall a tournament in which there was less combat than in this one, (I think Ari\u00b4s trap/blight was the only combat deck I saw).\n\nAll in all, it was nice to play a tournament and it seemes that we have to wait a while until the next opportunity. I\u00b4ll be more than happy to \"organize\" (host really) tournaments in the same venue.\n","score":"1gw4 + 3vp in the

Jay's 3rd seed placement\nwas conventional, but Karl wants nothing to do with Temptation. That part of\nhis plan works, Darby won't sit near Jay and instead plans to exploit the\nValkyrie's almost-slave status.\n\nThe early game proceeds as expected with Karl dropping a couple of early bleed\nbombs. Subsequent rushes from Matasuntha and a Valkyrie pretty much doom him.\n\nThe key interactions defining the game's development:\n  - Tim passes Jay's Ancient Influence, netting Jay 3 more beads than anyone\n    else and giving him a large safety margin.\n  - Matasuntha's early 1-pt bleed gets bounced with My Enemy's Enemy but Tim\n    throws it back at Karl, requiring a second MEE. The pool loss is\n    insignificant, but using the 2nd bounce gets Matasuntha an Enkil Cog one\n    turn earlier.\n\nOn the other side of the table, Darby sprinkles Disease counters and\nTemptations liberally. Marshall starts to bleed with the Valks, facing bleed\nreduction and S:CE lockdown. With three players now leaning left, Jay simply\nmoves faster at a minion-less Karl and gets the first oust.\n\nThings tilt in the 4-player as Jay makes it clear that Marshall will face no\npredation, immediately Rewilding Darby's Heidleburg Castle. The action is\nblocked but the shape of the endgame is clearly defined. Darby isn't happy\nabout having a pair of predators, especially since Mataunta has both the Eye of\nHazimel and Enkil Cog.\n\nMarshall shows down for a turn and Matasuntha gets flat-out burned with Society\nof Leopold. Jay has tons of pool and the Ecoterrorists, so Matasuntha V2 gets\nbeads as Marshall and Darby do bleedy things, leading to Tim getting ousted.\n\nMarshall correctly Rewilds the Heidleburg (instead of Jay's Ecoterrorists) and\nDarby loses an Impundulu with 4 life in a Trapped combat. Neither is completely\nhappy with that outcome, but Darby's resources are getting thin. Despite a\nhectic last turn, Darby can't quite defend his sole pool counter, but Marshall\ntaps out getting it.\n\nMatasunta immediately rushes Brunhilde and some chump eats her, setting\nMarshall on Jay's earlier path of \"it's time for V2.\" He has planned ahead and\nonly loses one turn - but that's enough to cause the game to time out.\n\nJay mentions that Marshall wins the game with 5 more minutes since Matasuntha\nV1 lost some important tools. Without that time available, Jay gleefully\naccepts the dubious honor of winning a tournament with exactly zero games wins\nfor the day.\n","score":"0gw2.5 + 1.5vp in the final","link":"http://www.vekn.net/event-calendar/event/9566","name":"Sauce or GTFO","player":"Jay Kristoff"},{"deckid":"2020bnpdms","event":"Black Night","date":"2020-02-20","location":"Palma de Mallorca, Spain","crypt":{"200305":{"q":4},"200034":{"q":4},"200011":{"q":1},"200871":{"q":1},"200890":{"q":1},"201151":{"q":1}},"library":{"100085":{"q":1},"100106":{"q":12},"100435":{"q":1},"100588":{"q":1},"100824":{"q":1},"100842":{"q":1},"100984":{"q":1},"101019":{"q":1},"101112":{"q":5},"101207":{"q":1},"101238":{"q":1},"101355":{"q":2},"101384":{"q":1},"102121":{"q":6},"102180":{"q":1},"102207":{"q":5},"100652":{"q":1},"100999":{"q":1},"102076":{"q":2},"100298":{"q":1},"100031":{"q":1},"100617":{"q":2},"100645":{"q":1},"100687":{"q":2},"101125":{"q":4},"101857":{"q":1},"101913":{"q":1},"100519":{"q":1},"100863":{"q":1},"101126":{"q":1},"101144":{"q":3}},"disciplines":["Presence","Daimoinon","Obfuscate","Animalism"],"timestamp":"2020-02-20","players":38,"format":"3R+F","description":"Description: Girls deck based on Jorge Delgado's deck\n","score":"1gw6 + 5vp in the final","link":"http://www.vekn.net/event-calendar/event/9512","name":"Girls","player":"Jordi Bestard"},{"deckid":"2020mdmlf","event":"Monde de merde","date":"2020-02-15","location":"Lyon , France","crypt":{"201035":{"q":4},"200076":{"q":4},"200468":{"q":1},"200185":{"q":1},"200211":{"q":1},"201318":{"q":1}},"library":{"100052":{"q":1},"100055":{"q":9},"100085":{"q":1},"100216":{"q":1},"100698":{"q":1},"100897":{"q":2},"100969":{"q":1},"101436":{"q":1},"101439":{"q":1},"101711":{"q":1},"101811":{"q":1},"102049":{"q":1},"102113":{"q":4},"102151":{"q":1},"102180":{"q":1},"100079":{"q":1},"100515":{"q":9},"100903":{"q":1},"101014":{"q":1},"101550":{"q":3},"101239":{"q":2},"100308":{"q":3},"100519":{"q":2},"100760":{"q":2},"101321":{"q":5},"100029":{"q":11},"100290":{"q":2},"100301":{"q":8},"100861":{"q":3},"101942":{"q":2},"101945":{"q":4},"101960":{"q":2},"100248":{"q":1}},"disciplines":["Animalism"],"timestamp":"2020-02-15","players":12,"format":"3R+F","description":"Description: Anarchy !!!!\n","score":"2gw6.5 + 1.5vp in the final","link":"http://www.vekn.net/event-calendar/event/9496","name":"Nanarch Buruku","player":"Mikael Lavallee"},{"deckid":"2020rtecnbjf","event":"Road to EC: New Blood","date":"2020-02-15","location":"Joensuu, Finland","crypt":{"201046":{"q":3},"201087":{"q":2},"200204":{"q":2},"200402":{"q":1},"200686":{"q":1},"200691":{"q":1},"200764":{"q":1},"201403":{"q":1}},"library":{"100058":{"q":2},"100327":{"q":1},"100426":{"q":1},"100545":{"q":1},"100588":{"q":2},"101225":{"q":1},"101384":{"q":1},"101619":{"q":1},"102113":{"q":4},"100006":{"q":2},"100845":{"q":11},"100243":{"q":1},"101014":{"q":1},"100401":{"q":4},"100492":{"q":2},"100765":{"q":2},"101062":{"q":1},"101712":{"q":4},"100518":{"q":6},"100598":{"q":2},"100680":{"q":6},"101259":{"q":1},"101321":{"q":4},"101578":{"q":2},"101949":{"q":1},"102137":{"q":1},"100918":{"q":5},"100973":{"q":2},"101649":{"q":2},"101945":{"q":2},"102071":{"q":1},"102169":{"q":5}},"disciplines":["Dominate","Fortitude","Auspex"],"timestamp":"2020-02-15","players":18,"format":"3R+F","description":"Second tournament of our \"Road to EC\" series.

Landed on 3 Neighbor John, instead of 3\nBlackhorse Tanner because of the lack of intercept in the deck. To compensate\nthat I added one Edward Neally to the deck, he has two really strong abilities,\neven if they are a bit situational. To boost the hand cycling capabilities of\nthe deck even further I decided to try one Katherine Stoddard too, which was\ngreat addition, as it basically won one round for me!\n","score":"3gw9.5 + 1.5vp in the final","link":"http://www.vekn.net/event-calendar/event/9541","name":"Grinderi","player":"Aapo J\u00e4rvelin"},{"deckid":"2020bhgbp","event":"Bydgoszcz Hunting Ground","date":"2020-02-15","location":"Bydgoszcz, Poland","crypt":{"200236":{"q":2},"200290":{"q":2},"200850":{"q":2},"200603":{"q":2},"200075":{"q":1},"201205":{"q":1},"200273":{"q":1},"201075":{"q":1}},"library":{"100545":{"q":2},"100945":{"q":1},"101019":{"q":1},"101067":{"q":1},"101384":{"q":1},"101388":{"q":2},"101439":{"q":1},"101536":{"q":1},"101811":{"q":2},"102113":{"q":5},"102189":{"q":1},"100079":{"q":1},"100726":{"q":8},"100103":{"q":8},"100298":{"q":1},"100243":{"q":1},"101014":{"q":1},"101114":{"q":3},"100324":{"q":9},"101402":{"q":7},"100519":{"q":2},"101321":{"q":4},"101949":{"q":5},"100250":{"q":4},"100344":{"q":8},"101196":{"q":2},"101942":{"q":5},"100709":{"q":1},"102079":{"q":2}},"disciplines":["Vicissitude","Auspex"],"timestamp":"2020-02-15","players":16,"format":"3R+F","description":"The seating in the final was !Ventrue grinder -> high cap Tremeres with Malgorzata\n   -> Eurobrujahs -> HoS grinder -> Asanbonsams.\n\nThe !Ven grinder almost managed to oust the Tremeres, but got stuck with some useless\ncards and got eliminated by the Asanbonsams close to the end of the final, the Tremeres\nalso fell a few moments later.

I had a rough idea of what I wanted to do, but I didn't really get down to it until the eve of the tournament, finished tweaking & consulting it with Marcin at midnight, which left me with no other testing ground than the tournament itself. The deck has some issues with blood management, a few Perfectionists would probably help with that. The guns should both be replaced with .44s, as the maneuver can either help move away from some more dangerous individuals or move closer to some single-manuever animalism, for example. I have not played Lupine Assault even a single time, so I'd get rid of that - there were always some cards I wanted to keep in my hand, there is nothing to retrieve them from the ash heap. Villeins should be replaced with Vessels, at least until the blood management issues are solved.

by Christian Nislev:\n\nThe attendance has been dropping in the last few years, but this year the trend\nturned upwards with 20 players participating \u2013 not least due to a strong\nturnout by non-Danes, for example Swedes from Malm\u00f6, who seem to have come out\nof torpor and hungry for blood.\n\nThe Danish meta is typically combat-heavy compared with elsewhere, but this\nyear saw a more moderate metagame with an even distribution of stealth-bleed,\nfat cap voters, ally-decks and a bit of combat.\n\nThe following players reached the final:\n1. Nikolaj Wendt 2 gw, 7.5 vp\n2. Sebastian Fredenberg 2 gw, 5 vp\n3. Rudolf Scholz 1 gw, 7.5 vp\n4. Henrik Andersen 1 gw, 6.5 vp\n5. Nico Scholz 1 gw, 5 vp\n\nWhile the ally decks were setting up at one end of the table, the bleed decks\nwere pressing forward from early on, and the bleed-bouncing was intense. After\nmore than an hour\u2019s play, Sebastian was ousted by Henrik who had three vampires\nout and another one on the way.\n\nThe last part of the final saw intense activity with Nikolaj promising Nico to\nhold off with bleeds so she could go forward in the hope of ousting Rudolf in a\nfew turns. Henrik pushed forward against Nikolaj but Nikolaj kept bouncing\nbleeds to Nico with Aksinya\u2019s ability and Lost in Translation. To cycle cards,\nHenrik stealthed past Nico\u2019s blocking minions to deliver a strong bleed against\nher. Nikolaj saw his chance and informed Nico that he would break the deal\nsince she was now within ousting range. Shortly after, she was ousted.\n\nWith a few minutes left, Rudolf pressed Henrik hard and came close to ousting\nhim, but he ran out of time before the final few bleed actions could be carried\nout.\n\nWith Nikolaj and Henrik on 1.5 VPs each, Nikolaj won the Danish National\nChampionship 2019 due to entering the final in top position.\n\nA highly unusual final of a Danish championship, with neither combat or vote\ndecks present. The winner was, however, not unexpectedly, Nikolaj Wendt \u2013 a\nformer Prince of Copenhagen (now in exile in Serbia) and enfant terrible of the\nDanish V:TES scene who has for many years been THE player to beat in Denmark\n(rumour has it that ousting him in casual games is worth 1.5 VPs...).\n\nNikolaj's comment: \"Aksinya is one of my favorite vampires, and I have been\ntrying to slot her into different archetypes (previously the obvious ANI one).\nShe offers great support for the problems that I feel weenie PRE decks normally\nface.\"\n","score":"2gw7.5 + 1.5vp in the final","link":"http://www.vekn.net/event-calendar/event/9430","name":"Aksinya weenie PRE -

A bleedy grandpredator with a bloating predator and a Summon History ally deck downstream. In each case, a Rachel Brandywine deck that relies on Homoculus across from me. It made for a couple of game wins and great seeding going into the finals.\n\nI was able to get that same bleedy grandpredator with a bloating predator in the finals, and the Nergal deck was pointed away from me.

Stavros is really the star\nand every time I saw Alicia Burrows, I just wished it was Stavros. It may be\nbetter to shrink the crypt up more by replacing both Alicias with another\nStavros and Fabrizia. Switching to 4/5 would add some OBF help with !Nosferatu\nweenies, but loses General Perfidio Dios. The extra vote and extra place to\ntoss Powerbase: Madrid votes is useful but may be making the deck too large\noverall.\n\nI chose this deck for the day because it tends to have surprising\nsurvivability. I got 2 GW on NAC Day One this year with it and I have great\nfamiliarity with it. Since the event was going to include many folks I had\nnever played with, I wanted that familiarity and reliability. I squeaked into\nthe finals with 1 GW 5 VPs, earning my game win in round one, but face Darby\nKeeney's Temptation deck in rounds 2 and 3 plus the final (my deck stalled in\nboth directions). His deck is a solid counter to mine: Temptation, allies that\ncan steal blood (and life), and permacept in Bupe and Saatet-Ta.\n\nFor me the day revolves around battling that same Temptation deck over and over\nand over, but there was more to the final that just our two decks.\n\n1st seed Dave Litwin Dmitra Breed/Boon 0.5 VP ->\n3rd seed Bill Troxel Mordecai Ben-Nun Anarch Legionnaires 0.5 VP ->\n5th seed Kevin Mitcham Arika with G2/3 Ventrue 0.5 VP ->\n4th seed Me 1.5 VP ->\n2nd seed Darby Keeney Temptation 0 VP\n\nI had no seating choice and am not sure where I would have sat had I been given\na choice. I am pretty sure that Darby chose to sit in front of me because in\nour two previous encounters that day I did not manage to oust him. The latter\nencounter ended with us being heads up and he was about 2 minutes from ousting\nme. I think it was his best seating choice given our previous interactions.\n\nI went fourth and had Fabrizia, so I was able to get the baby-making going\nearly. I had some extra time without interference, since Kevin's first vampire\nwas Arika. Darby brought Bupe up early so I was spending more stealth than I\nwanted to do normal things like hunting. Bill was dumping large portions of his\nlibrary with Liquidation and Kevin was rightly concerned. He tried to Entrance\nthe first Legionnaire, but 2 Detect Authorities and 3 intercept later, he was\ncaught losing a lot of blood in the process. This left the window open for\nDarby to Tempt Arika. With Dave putting Dmitra in play, Darby needed to\nuse Arika to help him oust, since stealing his prey's vampires was not as\neffective. That being said, Dmitra was trying to help Arika get blood back.\n\nThe game shifted to everyone hanging on. Bill kept getting more Legionnaires\nand had The Unamsking and FBI in play. Kevin got up two more large Ventrue.\nI was up to around 8 minions with Fabrizia Tempted and 2 Creation Rites in\ntorpor. Darby was making the most headway using Arika effectively and getting\nDave's pool to single digits.\n\nThen the game state changed. Neither Dave nor Kevin liked The Unmasking and I\nhad drawn The Uncoiling. I made a deal with the table to have them pass a Con\nBoon !Malk (for 7) and I would put The Uncoiling in play. Darby was making\nsolid progress and put the Fear of Mekhet on Arika to reduce her high blood\ntotal to make it easier to grab her with the Temptation. Occasionally Dave was\nmaking a baby and Bill was still churning out Legionnaires. Bill made a first\npush against Kevin. Kevin was feeling the pressure and also irked by Darby\npartially controlling Arika. Kevin calls Anarchist Uprising to really put the\nhurt on Bill (and me), but Dave was up to six minions and Darby had enough that\nit was voted down because I would have been in position to get a quick 2 VPs.\n\nAfter that, I decided to make a move. I played Dream World and get Darby down to\n3 pool. I wasn't able to finish him. Darby is in a no-win position and has\nDave, Kevin, and me working on him. After some forward action, he transfers\nout. This both hurts and helps me later in the game. Dave makes little\nprogress against Bill. With a VP on the table, Bill makes a big push against\nKevin. Kevin is really low on his turn and makes some progress on me as he\ngains pool. With Darby gone, the Fear of Mekhet kept on of Kevin's vampires in\nthe game, which I had not counted on. I took a decent amount of damage.\n\nI decide that survival is more important than going forward against Dave, since\nI didn't have a Dream World to play. Instead I farm my Blood Dolls and call a\nCon Boon. The Boon passes as Dave figures, I may need to survive Bill and he\ncan't take Bill heads-up (even if he has the tie-breaker).

Oh,\nand I did get to use book of going forth by night to steal Rock Cat, which was\ncool but didn\u00b4t really contribute to victory. 1+4 for me.\n\nI decided to have same prey than round 3 in the finals and sit in front of\nJyris dementation bleed. I thought that I could let Petri bleed some and then\nget rid of his minions, hopefully getting 2 points. Didn\u00b4t go as planned - had\nsome difficulties finding rushes, had to defend my own pool and Petri ousted\nhis prey relly quickly. When there was only half an hour left, I figured that I\nshould help Matias oust Jyri. That would make it more difficult to Petri to get\na second point, it would\u00b4t change anything for me - I still needed to get Petri\nout. I had one good round which did the trick - four rushes forward torporizing\nat least 3 (maybe 4, not sure) Tension was in the table and then bleeding with\nCodex was enough to oust Petri. Matias made one more effort against me and then\nraised his hands.\n\nAbout the deck: I made the deck day before tournament so it wasn\u00b4t tested. It was surprisingly solid. I didn\u00b4t use Heidelberg in any rounds. Possible changes would be removing dreams and Heidelberg, adding wall street maybe (dreams is too easily contested and card flow is quite ok). Fleetnes was actually important so maybe another one. Under siege and Mantle of bestial majesty are other key cards.\n","score":"2gw8.5 + 3vp in the final","link":"http://www.vekn.net/event-calendar/event/9397","name":"Xendil multirush with baby-snakes","player":"Lasse P\u00f6yry"},{"deckid":"2019zbncsbnzp","event":"Zabrze by Night - cykl Silesia by Night","date":"2019-10-12","location":"Zabrze, Poland","crypt":{"200076":{"q":4},"200424":{"q":3},"200956":{"q":3},"200080":{"q":2}},"library":{"100106":{"q":12},"100545":{"q":1},"100588":{"q":2},"100698":{"q":1},"100824":{"q":1},"101355":{"q":2},"101384":{"q":1},"101439":{"q":1},"102121":{"q":5},"102151":{"q":1},"102180":{"q":1},"101249":{"q":1},"101550":{"q":8},"100645":{"q":1},"100761":{"q":2},"100994":{"q":2},"100308":{"q":3},"100760":{"q":4},"101321":{"q":4},"101717":{"q":7},"100356":{"q":1},"100563":{"q":10},"100585":{"q":4},"100601":{"q":3},"100980":{"q":3},"101507":{"q":3},"101945":{"q":5},"100581":{"q":1}},"disciplines":["Animalism","Celerity","Fortitude","Protean","Thaumaturgy"],"timestamp":"2019-10-12","players":19,"format":"3R+F","description":"Description: Bram van Stappen idea with minor changes\n","score":"3gw9 + 1.5vp in the final","link":"http://www.vekn.net/event-calendar/event/9343","name":"Enkidu Anarch","player":"\u0141ukasz Ho Thanh"},{"deckid":"2019ervrsp","event":"Elysium Reus V","date":"2019-10-05","location":"Reus, Spain","crypt":{"201261":{"q":2},"200567":{"q":2},"201182":{"q":1},"200031":{"q":1},"200285":{"q":1},"200798":{"q":1},"200210":{"q":1},"200221":{"q":1},"200406":{"q":1},"200952":{"q":1},"200583":{"q":1}},"library":{"100081":{"q":1},"100199":{"q":6},"100332":{"q":1},"100545":{"q":1},"101384":{"q":1},"101388":{"q":3},"101822":{"q":2},"102088":{"q":1},"102113":{"q":5},"102132":{"q":1},"100477":{"q":16},"101083":{"q":2},"102206":{"q":2},"100298":{"q":1},"100855":{"q":1},"100966":{"q":1},"101272":{"q":5},"101419":{"q":1},"101491":{"q":2},"102087":{"q":1},"102202":{"q":1},"100903":{"q":1},"100401":{"q":4},"101223":{"q":2},"100518":{"q":6},"100519":{"q":2},"101321":{"q":3},"100273":{"q":3},"101966":{"q":3},"102012":{"q":3},"102164":{"q":2},"102079":{"q":3}},"disciplines":["Thaumaturgy","Dominate"],"timestamp":"2019-10-05","players":23,"format":"3R+F","description":"2 vp, 2 vp, 0 vp, 3 vp in the final\n","score":"0gw4 + 3vp in the final","link":"http://www.vekn.net/event-calendar/event/9360","name":"Cryptic Mission","player":"Tom\u00e0s L\u00f3pez Jim\u00e9nez"},{"deckid":"2019vovl","event":"Vilnius Open","date":"2019-10-05","location":"Vilnius, Lithuania","crypt":{"201270":{"q":5},"200907":{"q":4},"200415":{"q":2},"200943":{"q":1}},"library":{"100435":{"q":1},"100493":{"q":1},"100710":{"q":2},"100723":{"q":1},"100824":{"q":1},"100842":{"q":1},"100984":{"q":1},"101019":{"q":3},"101238":{"q":1},"101388":{"q":1},"101711":{"q":1},"102180":{"q":1},"101557":{"q":1},"101705":{"q":1},"101886":{"q":1},"100265":{"q":1},"100726":{"q":8},"101284":{"q":1},"100324":{"q":6},"100645":{"q":3},"100905":{"q":4},"102183":{"q":4},"101313":{"q":3},"100092":{"q":4},"100863":{"q":4},"101321":{"q":2},"101949":{"q":6},"101697":{"q":1}},"disciplines":["Auspex","Chimerstry","Vicissitude","Animalism"],"timestamp":"2019-10-05","players":16,"format":"3R+F","description":"I think 7-8 Will-o-the-Wisps would be better.

I was expecting violent metas (and was right), so\nI decided to improve the combat defense by including Unleashes. The previous\nversions had included Scout Youngwood, and Arishat as the only Baali, but I\ndecided the other Baalis would do just fine, and their specials would come\nhandy (I used all of them, too).\n\nThe preliminary rounds of the tournament were very difficult with rush decks\nall around. In the second round, I brought up my first minion after an hour and\n50 minutes, just to be immediately rushed and eaten. Luckily though, I had\nsomehow managed to win the first game and squeezed into the final as the last\nseed.\n\nIn the final, more or less everything went my way. Khursid behind me wasn't\ndrawing his Legionnaires and the weenie Auspex in front of me couldn't match my\nconsistent five-stealth actions.

Finaly just 14 minutes left in time he ousted\nPasi, and that was point when Lasse started to play, getting plenty of\nlegionaires and so on.\n\nLucky for me, Esku did Parity shift backwards, gaining 3 pool, and allowing me\nto cast Anarchist uprising to out Lasse, and then I played Ancilla empowerment\nto lower Eskus pool to 1, and then it was easy enough to anounce bleed for 1,\nand stealth it through, since I had drawn finaly my stealth cards, by the help\nof Heart of cheating. When I did my last oust from Esku to gain 3 vps in Finals\nthere was only 1 and about 20 seconds left in clock.

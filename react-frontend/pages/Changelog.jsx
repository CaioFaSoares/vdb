            <h6>2021-11-23</h6>
            <ul>
              <li>Added "Or Older" filter option for Set search</li>
              <li>
                Fixed Import/Export for new multigroup vampires (Victoria Ash,
                etc). Will append "(GX)" after name, confirmed to be implemented
                same way in Lackey
              </li>
              <li>Many other small fixes (mainly UI)</li>
            </ul>

            <h6>2021-11-13</h6>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Reworked Inventory page with significant performance improvement
                (most noticeable on BIG inventories) for both rendering and
                Import
              </li>

              <li>
                Update card base to 2021-10-27 (no new precons yet, just Promos
                and Ravnos/Chimersty POD reprints). New crypt "revival" cards
                with different groups are not yet working correctly with
                import/export, it will be fixed later Add "negative" option to
                some crypt/library filters (logic options are OR "//", AND "&"
                and NOT "!" or just OR/NOT depending on filter). THIS IS
                BREAKING CHANGE FOR OLD SEARCH URLs working with this filters,
                please update them if you shared it publicly and expect to
                continue to work. I dont like to break things, but sometimes
                it's necessary

              </li>
              <li>

            <h6>2021-10-29</h6>
            <ul>

              window Proxy missing cards Back to Decks Copy URL to compare
              (simple way to share your ideas of how to improve friend's deck:
              clone his deck into your account, change it as you like, compare
              both and share compare url with friend).
              <li>

            <ul>
              <li>
                Added Hide deck option ("bulb" button in advanced deck
                selection, the "binoculars" button) which hides the deck from
                main deck selector. Can be useful to "archive" the decks and
                simplify navigation between active decks.
              </li>
              <li>Added By-Group and By-Name sorting for crypt in Deck</li>

                of rescale to 75 cards
              </li>
              <li>Rulings opens in separate browser tab on click by default</li>
              <li>Many small UI improvements and fixes</li>
            </ul>

                Fixed sorting of multi-types and multi-disciplines to alphabet

                same for disciplines, regardless of Basic/Superior)
              </li>
              <li>

              </li>
              <li>Fix tag remove in advanced deck selection window</li>

            </ul>

            <h6>2021-10-05</h6>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Nothing "new", just many tiny UI improvements (under the hood
                they are not that small, so please report problems/glitches/etc
                they are expected) and some bugfixes (also rulings update)
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h6>2021-09-23</h6>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Add clan filter for Deck Selection window ("goggles" icon)
              </li>
              <li>Add draw chances in open hand for card-types in library</li>

              <li>
                Add import from Lackey .dek format (I don't use Lackey so cannot
                extensively test it, please report bugs if you find it)
              </li>
              <li>Moved Navigation bar to bottom on mobile</li>
              <li>
                Move inventory-mode switch to burger menu in Navigation bar on
                mobile
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h6>2021-09-21</h6>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Improved Inventory quantity calculation (shows Total+Unique and
                Missing+Unique) consistently regardless of chosen filter (All /
                Owned / Problem).
              </li>
              <li>
                Add Discipline summary in Deck library info. Thanks to Igor
                Beslin for proposal!
              </li>
              <li>
                Improved internal URL-ing between tabs, going back-forward with
                browser methods will be better (still not perfect, though).
              </li>
              <li>
                Crypt search for Title trait will show vampires with relevant
                title while merged. For other traits no changes (title is
                visible in result line and other traits requires reading card,
                so will be too confusing to clarify who have trait in-built and
                who needs merge). Thanks to Hobbesgoblin for proposal!
              </li>
              <li>Small other fixes</li>
            </ul>

            <h6>2021-09-16</h6>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Add tags info into main deck window long-awaited necessary
                feature, I apologize for delaying with it
              </li>
              <li>Add deck/intentory export to Excel format (.xslx)</li>
              <li>
                Export to CSV format changed into "Quantity,Card ID" (ID's
                according to VEKN CSV cardbase) will be more convenient for any
                kind of automation (Card ID is much more reliable than name),
                and end-users with spreadsheets should be satisfied with Excel
              </li>
              <li>
                Export All decks now returns zip-archive with all files to
                simplify saving (also with timestamp, so your "MY BEST DECKS FOR
                PROGENY" folder is now easier to manage). Now only for text
                formats (lackey, twd, etc), but will also support CSV, Excel in
                the future
              </li>
              <li>Small other fixes</li>
            </ul>

            <h6>2021-09-14</h6>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Add chance calculation of drawing X unique crypt cards (click
                (i) button). Was not easy to do it, but totally worth it.
              </li>
              <li>Add banned card indication for TWD and user deck</li>
              <li>
                Improved many popoup (modal) windows on mobile (like advanced
                deck select, import from precon/deck to inventory, etc). They
                are not as detailed as wide desktop windows, but at least
                usable.
              </li>
              <li>Some other fixes (incl. last report by Hobbesgoblin)</li>
            </ul>

            <h6>2021-09-12</h6>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Add Unleased Kickstarter as a Set/Precons (it's not an
                "official" set, but should be more useful like this)
              </li>
              <li>
                Fix deck crypt discipline layout for decks with many different
                disciplines in crypt (as in bundles or in some decks like "Girls
                will find...")
              </li>
              <li>Small other fixes</li>
            </ul>

            <h6>2021-09-10</h6>
            <ul>
              <li>Add images of banned reprints (Ashlesha, etc)</li>
              <li>Add clan images to precon filter in crypt/library search</li>
              <li>Save crypt/library sorting to browser local storage</li>
              <li>
                Decrease discipline/clan icons sizes (most notable on mobile)
              </li>
              <li>
                Improved crypt discipline alignment on mobile (should be better
                on wider resultions, but may cause problems on narrower- will
                try to fix it in the future, idk how though)
              </li>
              <li>Other small fixes & improvements</li>
            </ul>

            <h6>2021-09-08</h6>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Add "Advancement" trait for Crypt search, showing all Advanced
                vampires and their Base versions
              </li>
              <li>
                Add reference to/from Base/Adv vampires in detailed card view
                (hover over to see another version)
              </li>
              <li>Save "Add Mode" state to browser local storage</li>
              <li>
                Copy URL buttons grouped in menu and "Immutable URL" renamed to
                "Snapshot URL"
              </li>
              <li>
                Fix draw chances to exclude already "played" cards from
                calculation
              </li>
              <li>Fix "None" Discipline search in Library</li>
              <li>
                Fix removing additional filters of Discipline/Type in Library.
                Thanks to inm8
              </li>
              <li>Many other small fixes & improvements</li>
            </ul>

            <h6>2021-08-30</h6>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Changed colors in light theme. I know theming it's very
                subjective topic, but I hope you will soon get used to it and
                like it
              </li>
              <li>
                Added AND/OR switch for Type and Discipline search in Library
                when searching with multiple filters. Newly added filter form
                opens by default after you click [+] button.
              </li>
              <li>
                Disciplines in crypt draw are now aligned same as in deck view.
              </li>
              <li>
                Added 'Immutable URL' which will gives permanent URL for freezed
                current deck state, which is good when you want to freeze the
                deck and share it, while continue to edit in your deck archive
                (e.g. blog posts, etc). Same purpose as Deck-in-URL, but instead
                of storing everything about the deck in URL it just store
                non-editable deck copy on the server (Deck-in-URL is longer, but
                bulletproof can be "decoded" even if VDB is dead, and can be
                "generated" with 3rd-party tools).
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h6>2021-08-21</h6>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Some elements will "stick" during scrolling (like crypt in
                /Deck, library info line in /Deck, side buttons in /Crypt and
                /Inventory, deck change menu in /Crypt and /Library)
              </li>
              <li>
                Add inventory-mode highlight in pdf proxy selection it will show
                RED untill you select quantity required to resolve all inventory
                problems (can require even more copies than in this decks if you
                dont have enough even for other decks).
              </li>
              <li>
                Add button "Add missing in Inventory" to pdf proxy selection it
                will check & set minumum quantity to resolve inventory problems
                for this deck (opposite to color-highlight as said above which
                shows problems for entire deck collection, this button will not
                set quantity for more than required for this deck)
              </li>

              <li>
                Changed some trait search to show more cards (some cards will be

            <h6>2021-03-20</h6>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Deck-ID now attaches to url in url bar (same url as you got
                after clicking 'Copy URL' button, so all old links must continue
                to work and existing url in url bar is shareable now)
              </li>
              <li>
                Card scans from different sets done by vtes.pl team. Click on
                the Set name in card detailed popup window (yeah, I know it's
                barely discoverable, so consider it hidden feature for now,
                later I'll improve it)
              </li>
              <li>Added clan icons for Precon deck selector</li>
              <li>
                Deck select (for My and Precon decks) now support live text
                filter (same as for Clan in Crypt/Library search)
              </li>
              <li>Revision name now attaches to Deck name for Export</li>
              <li>
                Fixed Crypt/Library search not showing cards matching text after

              </li>
              <li>
                Fixed Deck Draw bug (incorrect message preventing from redraw)
              </li>
              <li>Other minor fixes/improvements I forgot about? Who knows.</li>
            </ul>

            <h6>2021-03-14</h6>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Deck draw now let 'play' cards by clicking on them (instead of
                card view)
              </li>
              <li>Much faster TWD clan search</li>
              <li>
                Forms in Add New Card (/decks) and Quick card search (/cards)
                now also search by initials i.e. new words can start from part
                of given string. Thanks to Vincent Ripoll. Examples: Following
                searches will match 'Govern the Unaligned': gtu gtuna theunal
                Following searches will not match 'Govern the Unaligned': gtd
                galigned thealigned
              </li>
              <li>
                Add-Mode switch removed from Navbar, but instead Add-Mode follow

              <li>

              <li>Fixed exports for Deck-In-Url</li>
              <li>Other tiny fixes</li>

            <h6>2021-03-06</h6>
            <ul>
              <li>Added new feature deck revisions</li>
              <li>
                Added rulings from krcg (many more rulings with links to
                origin). Many thanks to Lionel Panhaleux who is doing great job
                maintaining rulings archive
              </li>
              <li>Card text updated to 2021-03-06</li>
              <li>TWD decks updated</li>
              <li>Many bug fixes</li>
            </ul>

            <h6>2021-02-28</h6>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Added quick card view page (vdb.smeea.casa/cards) where you can
                quick check the card by it's name.
              </li>
              <li>
                Show all search results in Crypt/Library in Inventory-mode, but
                added option to hide results not in inventory
              </li>
              <li>
                Improved search by Precons (there is still some issues with
                First Print / Only In searches for reprinted bundles (HttB, KoT
                and Anthlogy))
              </li>
              <li>
                Improved TWD Capacity search speed and it uses 4 brackets (like
                for Groups). Anarch Convert is excluded from Capacity
                calculation.
              </li>
              <li>Fixed Inventory 'Show only problem cards' bug</li>
              <li>Fixed Lackey export</li>
              <li>Small other barely noticable fixes/improvements</li>
            </ul>

            <h6>2021-02-23</h6>
            <ul>
              <li>Added TWD search by library size</li>
              <li>
                Updated TWD search by-card-type forms (added 'none', slightly
                changed ranges) Greatly increased TWD by-card-type search speed
                (finally, it is usable lol)
              </li>
              <li>Fix library cards clan search for double-clan</li>
            </ul>

            <h6>2021-02-22</h6>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Updated Deck page layout (more vertical space for Crypt/Library)
              </li>
              <li>
                Updated TWD search results to show capacity/clan for crypt and
                discipline/clan for library cards
              </li>
              <li>Added Preconstructed decks to Deck page to choose from</li>
              <li>
                Inventory mode for not-your-decks opened in Deck page (i.e. for
                TWD / shared by URL / Preconstructed): Highlights in red cards
                you don't have enough in Inventory; Highlights in yellow cards
                you have in total, but it will require to take it from one of
                'fixed' decks; No highlight if you have it available
              </li>
              <li>
                Button to show missing in inventory cards for the deck in Deck
                page. It respects deck/card inventory status (Flexible or Fixed)
                and for Virtual (@) decks and any not-yours (twd / precon /
                shared by url) it calculate as it's Flexible (i.e. allowing to
                re-use cards from other Flexible decks but NOT from Fixed)
              </li>
              <li>
                Proxy button allow to print only missing cards (same with
                inventory status as above)
              </li>
              <li>
                Card quantity manual enter (click on card quantity) in addition
                to [+]/[-] buttons
              </li>
              <li>
                Inventory page option to choose what to show: All (cards you
                have + cards you need) Only owned cards Only cards you have
                problem with (first column is still quantity you have, not
                'required')
              </li>
              <li>
                Additional 'Copy Deck-In-URL' button which 'encode' the deck to
                url. Why? Because standard Copy URL works as a 'pointer' to the
                deck in the author's deck archive it follows the changes (and
                deletion!) and even though it's OK most of the time (and maybe
                even desired), you may want to 'freeze' it to be sure the one
                following the link will ALWAYS see the deck in the state it was
                during URL creation. Technical details: this link contain all
                VDB need to render the deck (in the format
                ...?name=NAME&author=AUTHOR&description=DESCRIPTION#ID=QUANTITY;ID2=...
                where ID is card ID from official VEKN card list). So this
                'deck-in-urls' does not exist (and does not require to ever be
                created) on the VDB server and may be easily generated by anyone
                (e.g. by third-party software as quick way to show the deck
                using VDB rendering) as well as decoded even when VDB will stop
                to work it will be easy to restore the deck from the url
              </li>

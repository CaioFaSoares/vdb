## Installation

### Local Deployment (on Linux)

### Production Deployment

For production you should at least:
* setup web-server (we use `nginx`) instead of `parcel` embedded web-server
* setup wsgi-server (we use `gunicorn`) instead of `flask` embedded web-server
* build frontend for production (see your prefered bundler documentation, for `parcel` use `parcel build index.html`)
* change `app.config['SECRET_KEY']` in `config.py`

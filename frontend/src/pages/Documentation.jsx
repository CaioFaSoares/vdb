              <h6>Star Vampire</h6>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Match decks with more than 38% in the crypt being any
                  particular vampire (both Base + Adv), excluding Anarch Convert
                  (does not counted at all).
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      E.g.: 5x Arika + 7x Other is Star Deck
                      <tt>
                        <i> -&gt; 5/12 = 41%</i>
                      </tt>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Ex: 4x Arika + 4x AC + 4x Other is Star Deck
                      <tt>
                        <i> -&gt; 4/(4+4) = 50%</i>

                  </ul>
                  Reason for strange percentage (38%) is to include decks with 5
                  of 13 vampires (38,4%), but exclude everything below starting
                  from decks with 3 of 8 vampires (with 4+ Anarch Converts

                  Match decks with more than 60% vampires in the crypt of the
                  given clan, excluding Anarch Convert (does not counted at all)
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      E.g.: 5x Ventrue + 3 Anarch Convert + 3x Other is Ventrue
                      Deck
                      <tt>
                        <i> -&gt; 5/(5+3) = 62%</i>
                      </tt>
                    </li>

              <h6>Capacity Average</h6>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Calculated excluding Anarch Convert (does not counted at all)
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      E.g.: 5x 11-cap + 4x Anarch Convert + 3x 3-cap is 8 avg.
                      cap
                      <tt>
                        <i> -&gt; (5*11+3*3)/(5+3) = 8</i>

              <h6>Library Disciplines</h6>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Matches decks with library cards using all selected
                  disciplines at least once

                    <li>
                      E.g.: Deck with Condemnation: Mute (chi/dai/DAI card) will
                      match Chimerstry search, even if it was never planned by
                      the deck to use it with chi.
                    </li>

                  Public it can be searched (using similar set of filters as for
                  TWDA), viewed, copied by other players in the PDA page, and
                  can be deleted by the author (but as with any other deck,
                  author cannot delete your copy of the deck made with Copy deck
                  button)
                </li>
                <li>
                  Public Deck is created from one of your existing deck (parent)
                  in the Decks page using Public Archive button

                <li>
                  You can switch to/from your public (child) and parent deck

                </li>
                <li>
                  Public deck is non-editable with standard card buttons. The
                  only way to update Public Deck is to sync it with the parent
                  deck using Public Archive button in Deck page. It does not
                  automatically follows updates of the parent deck
                </li>
                <li>
                  We encourage people to mostly leave the deck unchanged after
                  publishing. For significant changes please create new deck
                  (feel free to use Description to give cross-references between
                  sister decks and/or give any explanation you want)

                <li>
                  Author can remove the deck from PDA anytime, but each re-add
                  creates new copy of the deck and it will be listed again (not

              <h6>Hints</h6>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  VDB save changes automatically, you don&apos;t have to do
                  anything to save the deck. If it cannot save the change (i.e.
                  network problem) it will immediatelly revert the change, the
                  cards you see in the deck is what actually saved on the
                  server. You can close the page anytime without losing
                  progress.
                </li>
                <li>
                  You can change card quantity by clicking on the quantity to
                  enter number manual
                </li>
              </ul>

              <h6>URLs</h6>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Standard URL (Copy URL button) - copy URL to the deck and
                  follow your changes.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Immutable URL - create link to unchangeable copy of the deck.
                  Good for forum/blog posts and where you want everybody to have
                  same exact deck forever (your future changes in the deck will
                  not change the deck by the link).
                </li>
                <li>
                  Deck-in-URL - copy URL containing everything about the deck.
                  Bulletproof, can be decoded even if VDB is dead. Good, but
                  long.
                </li>
              </ul>

              <h6>Draw Probability</h6>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Draw probability in main deck window available on (i) button
                  is calculated as initial draw of 4 crypt and 7 library.

                  Draw probability in draw simulator available on Deck Draw
                  button is calculated as chance to initially draw cards in
                  existing hand (with respect to hand size and discarded cards).
                  It is not the chance to draw additional cards to your hand,
                  but chance to draw cards in the hand in the first place
                  (imagine you return hand to the library, excluding already
                  played cards, shuffle it and draw back to your hand size)
                </li>
                <li>

                INVENTORY MANAGEMENT
              </h5>
              Inventory management in VDB let you browse your card collection
              with existing crypt/library search and track how collection is
              used in your existing decks
              <h6>Add cards from you collection:</h6>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  One by one using &#39;Add Card&#39; forms on top (last card
                  you add stays on top so you can change quantity without
                  scrolling down)
                </li>
                <li>
                  Add full deck from your Deck collection (be careful you can
                  add one deck multiple times doubling the quantity)
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h6>Search cards from inventory:</h6>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Go to Crypt or Library search page (the one you use to search
                  all VTES cards)
                </li>
                <li>Activate Inventory Mode in the top-left corner</li>
                <li>
                  Now all searches you do will search in your inventory (and you
                  can swap to-from all VTES cards any time to repeat search with
                  new &#39;source&#39;)
                </li>
                <li>
                  Two columns left to capacity show: total cards you have in
                  inventory & used cards in your decks (read below about it)
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h6>
                To track how cards are used in your decks, each deck has the one
                of the following status:
              </h6>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <div className="d-inline px-2">
                    <At />
                  </div>
                  Virtual (default). These decks are excluded from inventory
                  management tracking, like you want for virtual Lackey decks or
                  your in-progress projects
                </li>
                <li>
                  <div className="d-inline px-2">
                    <Shuffle />
                  </div>
                  Flexible. These decks can share cards between them, like you
                  want for your temporary test decks or if your card pool is not
                  big (yet)
                </li>
                <li>
                  <div className="d-inline px-2">
                    <PinAngleFill />
                  </div>
                  Fixed. These decks each use unique cards like for your
                  permanent decks you dont want to disassembly between game
                  sessions
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                You can change status of the deck in Deck page by clicking
                Status button next to deck select form
              </p>
              <p>
                Additionally you can set status per-card (i.e. if your deck is
                fixed except few Masters you swap between decks) clicking on the
                icon to the left of the card in the deck list. All other cards
                of the deck will continue to be of the deck status
              </p>
            </div>
          </div>
        </Col>
      </Row>
    </Container>

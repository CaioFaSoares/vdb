    "Solved CONNECTION PROBLEM for TWD with a lot of results, and reduced network usage for such searches for up to 15x, which must be very noticeable on slowest connections",
    "Add Check TWD Report page (from 'More' button in TWD; not designed for mobile screen size) help prepare and check report before submit to https://www.vekn.net/forum/event-reports-and-twd - it will highlight some discrepancies from VEKN Event entry and common issues. It is not magic tool to do the job for you, it only helps but you must read and follow guidelines (see pinned post in Event Reports by the link above)",
    "Small other fixes, including modal windows sizes (may still be not perfect, but more standardized as of now)"

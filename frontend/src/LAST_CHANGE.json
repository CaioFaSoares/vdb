    "Allow custom card types values to search TWDA, should allow a lot more deep analyzing of meta trends",
    "Add Playable By (bullseye icon) button to library card window to run crypt search (will search all disciplines for combo-disciplines cards, you must manually remove discipline you don't need)",
    "Restore working on Firefox in Incognito mode (will fetch cardbase each time though, so may not be optimal on slow networks)",
    "Update TWDA",

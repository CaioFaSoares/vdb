    "Update TWDA",
    "Add Legacy Crypt images feature, which will show Jyhad-styled crypt images but with modern card text. Only few clans are available now (Abomination, Ahrimanes, Baali, Tzimisce) but more will come with the goal of having full crypt. To enable it switch Legacy Crypt toggle in https://vdb.im/account page. Thanks to Thiago Sousa for that fantastic contribution!",
    "Small other fixes and improvements. This update include code tidy-up changes to old components to improve further developmentm, but it could introduce new bugs. Please don't hesitate to report if something is wrong!"
